## 📊 What is Bitsgap?

Bitsgap is a powerful cloud-based platform designed to streamline cryptocurrency trading across multiple exchanges using a single unified interface. By connecting your exchange accounts through secure API keys, Bitsgap allows you to manage trades, track assets, and automate strategies without switching tabs or juggling multiple logins. This centralized access reduces complexity and boosts productivity for traders who operate across multiple markets.

Bitsgap supports over 15 of the world’s leading exchanges, including Binance, Kraken, KuCoin, Bitfinex, and Coinbase Pro. Within the platform, users can view price charts, market depth, and trade history in real time. It also features an intelligent order system with support for stop-loss, take-profit, trailing orders, and shadow orders that are hidden from the exchange's order book.

In addition to manual trading, Bitsgap is known for its highly customizable trading bots. The DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) and Grid bots can be fine-tuned based on your strategy, trading pair, time interval, and risk level. Users can backtest these bots with historical data before going live, allowing them to optimize performance with minimal risk.

The platform also offers a powerful arbitrage tool that identifies price differences for the same assets across exchanges. This enables users to act on profitable spread opportunities manually or automatically, depending on their preferences. Bitsgap's dashboard includes real-time portfolio monitoring, PnL tracking, and deep analytics that help you understand your trading performance and fine-tune your strategies accordingly.

Bitsgap is cloud-based, meaning it requires no software installation and can be accessed from any browser. However, Pro users can download the desktop app for even faster performance and secure local access. All data transmissions are encrypted, and API keys are stored with the highest level of security to ensure that users maintain full control over their funds.

Whether you're a casual crypto trader or managing a high-frequency trading operation, Bitsgap provides all the tools needed to trade smarter, faster, and more efficiently—without writing a single line of code.
